**Project 2: Multi-Source Sales Performance Data Analysis Platform** requires students to build a comprehensive Python-based analytics application that processes and analyzes real-world business data from multiple online sources. The project integrates three distinct data formats: **CSV sales data** from the Superstore dataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/superstore-sales/master/data/superstore.csv) containing order details, customer information, product categories, sales amounts, and regional data; **JSON customer review data** for sentiment analysis and customer behavior insights; and **Excel product catalog files** with inventory information, pricing data, and product specifications across multiple worksheets. Students must implement automated data ingestion, cleaning, and validation processes that handle missing values, data type inconsistencies, and cross-source data correlation while creating derived metrics such as customer lifetime value, product performance rankings, seasonal sales trends, and regional analysis.

The technical implementation demands proficiency in core Python data science libraries including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, requests for online data fetching, openpyxl for Excel processing, and matplotlib/plotly for visualization creation. Students must develop modular data processing pipelines that automatically refresh data from online sources, implement statistical analysis functions for trend identification and forecasting, create customer segmentation algorithms using demographic and purchase behavior data, and build an interactive dashboard system with filtering capabilities and drill-down analysis. The project expects delivery of comprehensive business intelligence reports with automated insights generation, multi-format export capabilities (PDF, Excel, JSON), executive summary dashboards showing key performance indicators, and historical trend analysis with predictive modeling - demonstrating mastery of data structures, file handling, functions, classes, and exception handling while producing actionable business insights from real-world datasets that showcase professional-level data analysis capabilities.
